# arcade-game (Udacity project)

This project is part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree program. Demonstrates knowledge object-oriented JavaScript.

## Introduction

This game is based on the arcade classic game, Frogger.

## How to run the game

You can [play the game here](https://nickhericks.github.io/arcade-game/) or download the repository to you local computer and open the index.html file in a web browser of your choice.

## How to play

Use the directional arrow keys (up, down, left, right) on the keyboard to move the player. Player must reach the water without colliding with any enemies(bugs).
